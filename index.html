          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li> The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li> The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
